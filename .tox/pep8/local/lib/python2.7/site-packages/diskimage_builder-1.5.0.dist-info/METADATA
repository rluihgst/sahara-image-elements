Image building tools for OpenStack
==================================

``diskimage-builder`` is a flexible suite of components for building a
wide-range of disk images, filesystem images and ramdisk images for
use with OpenStack.

This repository has the core functionality for building such images,
both virtual and bare metal.  Images are composed using `elements`;
while fundamental elements are provided here, individual projects have
the flexibility to customise the image build with their own elements.

For example::

  $ DIB_RELEASE=trusty disk-image-create -o ubuntu-trusty.qcow2 vm ubuntu

will create a bootable Ubuntu Trusty based ``qcow2`` image.

``diskimage-builder`` is useful to anyone looking to produce
customised images for deployment into clouds.  These tools are the
components of `TripleO <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO>`__
that are responsible for building disk images.  They are also used
extensively to build images for testing OpenStack itself, particularly
with `nodepool
<http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/nodepool.html>`__.
Platforms supported include Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Fedora.
