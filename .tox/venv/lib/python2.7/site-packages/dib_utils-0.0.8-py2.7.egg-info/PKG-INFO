Description: Standalone tools related to diskimage-builder
        =============================================
        
        These tools were originally part of the diskimage-builder project, but they have
        uses outside of that project as well.  Because disk space is at a premium in
        base cloud images, pulling in all of diskimage-builder and its dependencies just to
        use something like dib-run-parts is not desirable.  This project allows consumers
        to use the tools while pulling in only one small package with few/no additional
        dependencies.
