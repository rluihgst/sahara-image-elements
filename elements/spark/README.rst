spark
=====

Installs Spark on Ubuntu. Requires Hadoop (currently from CDH distribution).

This element will install Spark into an Ubuntu image. It tries to guess the
correct file to download based on the ``DIB_SPARK_VERSION`` and ``DIB_CDH_VERSION``
variables, but this behaviour can be overridden by using ``SPARK_DOWNLOAD_URL``
to specify a download URL for a pre-built Spark tar.gz file. See
http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html for more download options.

Versions
--------

This element is able to generate images containing any valid Spark version,
compiled against one version of Hadoop HDFS libraries.

Only some combinations of Spark and Hadoop versions are possible, depending on
the availability of a pre-compiled binary and only few of them are tested with
the Sahara Spark plugin.

The ``diskimage-create.sh`` script will use tested defaults. Those defaults
generate an image supported by the Sahara Spark plugin. Other combinations
should be used only for evaluation or testing purposes. Refer to the Sahara
Spark plugin wiki page (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Sahara/SparkPlugin)
for more information about tested and supported versions.
